# Bin Packing Problem Optimization Algorithmes
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of solutions and implementations for the Bin Packing 1D problem. It is a classic optimization problem where a set of items with varying sizes must be packed into a fixed number of bins, while minimizing wasted space.

### List of Implimented Algorithmes
- Branch and bound.
- Best Fit.
- First Fit.
- Next Fit.
- Worst Fit
- Tabu Search.
- Genetic Algorithme.
- Hybridation WWO and Simulated Annealing.

### Code & Language
- Code is written in Python language.
- The framwork for gui is Tkinter.
### For Testing
- First download or clone the repository.
- Second, ensure that you have installed the required libraries and you fix dependencies (path).
- There is a file nammed "testParameters.py", if you select another benchmarking file, you need to make changes in this file (Bins max size and Number of objects).
